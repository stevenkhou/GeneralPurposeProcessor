# General Purpose Processor

### About The Project:
FPGA based ALU design and implementation in a VHDL environment.
<br />
<br />
The processing unit consists of: 
- Control unit for fetching instructions and generating control signals.
- Bus manages access to data values throughout the processing unit
- Registers serve as temporary storage units
- ALU core executes arithmetic and logical operations on inputs and generates outputs
